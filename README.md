# Groovy Null Handling and Implicit Type Coercion

This repository demonstrates a potential issue in Groovy related to null handling and implicit type conversion.  The `bug.groovy` file contains a method that intends to gracefully handle null input, but the behavior may not be immediately obvious to developers unfamiliar with Groovy's dynamic typing.

The solution, provided in `bugSolution.groovy`, offers a more explicit approach to handle null values, enhancing code clarity and reducing potential surprises.
